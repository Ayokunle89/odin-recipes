    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Garri is produced in powder form with fine granules, which doesn’t qualify as grain. Even though it feels like grain when you touch it, it is grain-free. You can either soak it like regular cereal and paired with groundnut (peanuts), cashew nuts, fried fish, coconut, etc. It can also be made into eba as a ”swallow food” with different soups.</p>
